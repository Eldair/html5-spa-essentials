*An opinionated list of essential functionalities for HTML5 Single-Page-Apps (SPA)*

Welcome to my very *opinionated* list of essential functionalities for
developing HTML5 Single-Page-Apps (SPA). I'm regularly seeking the
net for new useful solutions and evaluating a lot of them. For each
functionality area there are usually one or more reasonable solutions.
Nevertheless, I force myself to pick a single *personal* preference
and add it to the following list. To let others also benefit from these
evaluation results, I provide this list publically. If you disagree with
any product selection, please feel free to just publish your own list.
